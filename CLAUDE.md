## Database Operations

### Querying the Remote D1 Database

The project uses Cloudflare D1 as the database. You can query the remote database directly using the Wrangler CLI.

#### Basic Query Commands

```bash
# Navigate to the server directory
cd apps/server

# Query the remote database (replace with your actual database name)
wrangler d1 execute onepercent-stats-new --remote --command "SELECT * FROM leads LIMIT 5"

# Get table structure
wrangler d1 execute onepercent-stats-new --remote --command "PRAGMA table_info(leads)"

# Count total records
wrangler d1 execute onepercent-stats-new --remote --command "SELECT COUNT(*) as total FROM leads"
```

#### Common Queries

```bash
# Get leads by platform
wrangler d1 execute onepercent-stats-new --remote --command "SELECT platform, COUNT(*) as count FROM leads GROUP BY platform ORDER BY count DESC"

# Get conversion data by status
wrangler d1 execute onepercent-stats-new --remote --command "SELECT status, COUNT(*) as count, SUM(sales) as total_sales FROM leads GROUP BY status"

# Get recent leads
wrangler d1 execute onepercent-stats-new --remote --command "SELECT id, name, platform, sales, created_at FROM leads ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10"

# Get leads with sales data (Closed Won status)
wrangler d1 execute onepercent-stats-new --remote --command "SELECT * FROM leads WHERE status = 'Closed Won' ORDER BY sales DESC"

# Get leads requiring follow-up
wrangler d1 execute onepercent-stats-new --remote --command "SELECT id, name, status, next_follow_up_date FROM leads WHERE status = 'Follow Up' ORDER BY next_follow_up_date"
```

#### Database Schema

The main tables in the database:

**leads table:**
- `id` (INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY)
- `month` (TEXT) - Month name (e.g., "May", "June")
- `date` (TEXT) - Date in DD/MM/YYYY format
- `name` (TEXT) - Lead's name
- `phone_number` (TEXT) - Phone number
- `platform` (TEXT) - Marketing platform text (synced with platforms table)
- `platform_id` (INTEGER) - Foreign key to platforms.id
- `status` (TEXT, DEFAULT "New") - Lead status: New, Contacted, Follow Up, Consulted, Closed Won, Closed Lost
- `sales` (INTEGER) - Sales amount in RM
- `remark` (TEXT) - Additional notes
- `trainer_handle` (TEXT) - Trainer handle text (synced with trainers table)
- `trainer_id` (INTEGER) - Foreign key to trainers.id
- `closed_date` (TEXT) - Date when lead was closed (DD/MM/YYYY)
- `closed_month` (TEXT) - Month when lead was closed
- `closed_year` (TEXT) - Year when lead was closed
- `contacted_date` (TEXT) - Date when lead was first contacted (DD/MM/YYYY)
- `next_follow_up_date` (TEXT) - Scheduled follow-up date (DD/MM/YYYY)
- `last_activity_date` (TEXT) - Last activity date (DD/MM/YYYY)
- `created_at` (TEXT) - Timestamp when record was created
- `updated_at` (TEXT) - Timestamp when record was last modified

**platforms table:**
- `id` (INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY)
- `name` (TEXT, UNIQUE COLLATE NOCASE) - Platform name (case-insensitive)
- `active` (INTEGER, DEFAULT 1) - 1 = active, 0 = deactivated
- `created_at` (TEXT) - Creation timestamp
- `updated_at` (TEXT) - Last update timestamp

**trainers table:**
- `id` (INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY)
- `handle` (TEXT, UNIQUE COLLATE NOCASE) - Trainer handle/name (case-insensitive)
- `name` (TEXT) - Display name (optional, for backward compatibility)
- `active` (INTEGER, DEFAULT 1) - 1 = active, 0 = deactivated
- `created_at` (TEXT) - Creation timestamp
- `updated_at` (TEXT) - Last update timestamp

**advertising_costs table:**
- `id` (INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY)
- `month` (INTEGER) - Month number (1-12)
- `year` (INTEGER) - Year
- `cost` (REAL) - Advertising cost amount
- `currency` (TEXT) - Currency (default "RM")
- `created_at` (TEXT) - Creation timestamp
- `updated_at` (TEXT) - Last update timestamp

**Important Notes:**
- Platform and trainer text fields are automatically synchronized with their master tables via database triggers
- Deactivated platforms/trainers (active=0) remain linked to existing leads but won't appear in selection dropdowns
- All platform and trainer names are case-insensitive (enforced by COLLATE NOCASE)

#### Database Migrations

```bash
# Generate new migration (after schema changes)
cd apps/server
bun run db:generate

# Apply migrations locally
bun run db:migrate:local

# Apply migrations to remote database
bun run db:migrate:remote

# Check migration status
wrangler d1 execute onepercent-stats-new --remote --command "SELECT * FROM __drizzle_migrations"
```

#### Local vs Remote Database

```bash
# Query local database
wrangler d1 execute onepercent-stats-new --local --command "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM leads"

# Query remote database  
wrangler d1 execute onepercent-stats-new --remote --command "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM leads"
```

#### Data Backup and Export

```bash
# Export data to SQL file
wrangler d1 export onepercent-stats-new --remote --output backup.sql

# Import data from SQL file
wrangler d1 execute onepercent-stats-new --remote --file backup.sql
```

#### Cloudflare Authentication

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT use `wrangler login` for authentication. Instead, use the API token from the `.env` file.

The project uses API token authentication which is automatically read from the `.env` file in `apps/server/`:
- `CLOUDFLARE_D1_TOKEN` - API token for D1 database access
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY` - Same token value for API access
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` - Account ID for Cloudflare operations
- `CLOUDFLARE_DATABASE_ID` - Database ID for the D1 database

Wrangler automatically reads these environment variables, so no manual authentication is needed.

#### Export/Import Data Between Remote and Local

```bash
# Export full database from remote
cd apps/server
wrangler d1 export onepercent-stats-new --remote --output=./backup.sql

# Export only data (no schema)
wrangler d1 export onepercent-stats-new --remote --output=./data-only.sql --no-schema

# Export only schema (no data)
wrangler d1 export onepercent-stats-new --remote --output=./schema-only.sql --no-data

# Import to local database (after clearing existing data)
wrangler d1 execute onepercent-stats-new --local --file=./backup.sql

# Clear local database tables before import
wrangler d1 execute onepercent-stats-new --local --command "PRAGMA defer_foreign_keys = true; DELETE FROM leads; DELETE FROM advertising_costs; DELETE FROM account; DELETE FROM session; DELETE FROM verification; DELETE FROM user;"
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Bun** (latest version) - [Install Bun](https://bun.sh)
- **Cloudflare account** - For D1 database and Workers deployment

### Quick Setup
```bash
# Clone and install
git clone <repository-url>
cd onepercent-stats
bun install

# Set up environment (copy from .env.example files)
cp apps/server/.env.example apps/server/.env
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env

# Start development
bun run dev
```

### Environment Variables
Both applications require environment setup. See individual CLAUDE.md files for complete lists:
- **Server**: Database credentials, auth secrets, CORS origins
- **Web**: API URLs, auth configuration

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Never use npm/yarn/pnpm** - This project uses Bun exclusively
- **Database operations** - Always run from `apps/server` directory
- **Authentication** - Uses API token authentication (not `wrangler login`)
- **Date format** - All dates use DD/MM/YYYY format consistently

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Column not found errors**: Apply migrations with `bun run db:migrate:remote`
- **Authentication errors**: Verify API token in `apps/server/.env`
- **Database not found**: Check database name in `apps/server/wrangler.jsonc`
- **CORS issues**: Verify `CORS_ORIGIN` matches your frontend URL
